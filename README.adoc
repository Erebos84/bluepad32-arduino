= {project-name} library for Arduino =

Enables gamepad support for NINA-based boards, like:

* Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
* Arduino Nano 33 IoT
* Arduino MKR WiFi 1010
* etc.

These boards have two processors:

* The main one, where the Arduino sketches run
* And the NINA (ESP32), which is used only to provide WiFi connectivity.

In order to use this library, you have to flash the Bluepad32 firmware in NINA.
This is a simple step that should only be done once, and can be undone at any time.

More info about Bluepad32 for NINA here:

* Instructions: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/blob/master/docs/plat_nina.md
* Download: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/-/releases


With this library you can use any modern Bluetooth gamepad in Arduino. Some of the supported gamepads, but not limited to are:

* DualSense (PS5)
* DualShock 4 (PS4)
* DualShock 3 (PS3)
* Wii Mote and extensions
* Wii U gamepad
* Switch gamepad
* Switch Joy-cons
* Xbox One S
